## Arduino Tools extension for VS Code

VS Code extension for Arduino Tools, such as language features and debugger.

### Quick Start
To build the Arduino Tools VS Code extension (VSIX), execute:
```
yarn
```

It will generate a `vscode-arduino-tools-x.x.x.vsix` file in the `./build-artifacts` folder.
In VS Code, open the `Extensions` panel, click on the ellipses (`...`) and select `Install from VSIX...`.
Or from the [_Command Palette_](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_install-from-a-vsix).

You can also start the extension in debug mode.
Open the `Debug` panel, and select the `Launch Arduino Tools â€“ VS Code Extension` launch configuration.
